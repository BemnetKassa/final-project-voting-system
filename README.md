this is just a web being developed to manage, control and show voting system of top final project compititors in our university of Arba Minch university which has a admin, result, and index page.
The admin page is for the admins to add and delete projects which are going to compete.
the result page is for everyone who are following the compitition. 
And the last page or the index page is the main page which is also for everyone but specifically for those who wants to give there vote on the selected projects.
